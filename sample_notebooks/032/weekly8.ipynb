    "<h4> An estimator for an exponential parameter </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's draw a dataset from an exponential distribution $\\operatorname{Exp}(\\lambda)$, which has mean $1/\\lambda$. We know that if we build a dataset $\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$ by sampling from this distribution, then the sample mean is an unbiased estimator for $1/\\lambda$. On your homework, you found that\n",

    "is *not* an unbiased estimator for $\\lambda$; for example, $E[T_1] = \\infty$. On the other hand, an easy-to-compute biased estimator with low variance is sometimes preferable to a hard-to-compute unbiased estimator with high variance. We'll explore what happens as $n \\to \\infty$ in the **following questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose that $\\lambda = 0.5$ and that $n = 2$. Make an estimate for $E[T_2]$ using an appropriate number of simulations. As an estimator for $\\lambda$, is it biased positively or negatively?\n",
    "* Repeat the previous part with $n = 10$ and $n = 100$. Can you make a conjecture for the behavior of $E[T_n]$ as $n \\to \\infty$?\n",

    "<h4> Quantifying efficiency of an estimator </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we know data is drawn from a uniform distribution $\\operatorname{Unif}(0, \\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is unknown. At this point, we have three different estimators for $\\theta$; they are\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A = 12 X_1^2,$ which is an unbiased for $\\theta^2$,\n",
    "* $B = 2 X_1$, which is unbiased (from the homework!), and\n",
    "* $C = \\max\\{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\}$, which has expectation $\\frac{n}{n + 1} \\theta$ (from the homework!).\n",
    "\n",
    "One tool for quantifying how \"good\" an estimator is the *mean squared error*, or MSE. It's defined as the mean of the squared error:\n",
    "$$MSE(T) = E[(T - \\theta)^2].$$ \n",
    "For an unbiased estimator, this is exactly the variance of $T$ itself; naturally, this means that smaller values are generally better. We'll explore the MSE for each of the three estiamtors for $\\theta$ in the **following questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose that you know $\\theta = 1$. Estimate the MSE of $A$ using an appropriate number of trials. (Note that $\\theta^2 = 1 = \\theta$ in this case!)\n",
    "* Estimate the MSE of $B$ under the same conditions.\n",
    "* Estimate the MSE of $C$ using $n = 1$, $n = 10$, and $n = 100$. Make a conjecture for what happens as $n \\to \\infty$."
