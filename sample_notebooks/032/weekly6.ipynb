    "* Generate $100$ random numbers from a $\\operatorname{Unif}(0, 1)$ distribution (this is what Python's `rand()` will default to). We'll let $Y$ be the average of these, $\\mu$ be its mean, and $\\sigma$ its standard deviation. Using an appropriate number of trials, estimate the probabilities $P(|Y - \\mu| \\ge 0.1)$ and $P(|Y - \\mu| \\ge 0.01)$. Compare your answers to the bound from Chebyshev's inequality; are your simulations consistent with the theory?\n",

    "Make use of the previous notebooks! You won't have to write very much from scratch. In fact, the only thing we haven't done yet is to generate random data from a Pareto distribution. The following does that:"
