This guide is intended to get you started using the UC Merced JupyterHub and set things up to the point that you can distribute them to students. Sample notebooks are included (the files with .ipynb format), as well as a PDF introduction. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Rosemarie Bongers or Sarvani Chadalapaka.
